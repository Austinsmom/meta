# About the EBP

The Executable Book Project is an international collaboration between
several universities and open source projects. It is primarily a collaboration
between groups at **The Australian National University**,
**Northern Arizona University**, and
**The University of California at Berkeley**. These teams collectively
represent many open source projects in the scientific community, specifically
**QuantEcon**, **QIIME**, and **The Jupyter Project**.

This project is funded by a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan foundation.
